This is a project for hshacks! 

A simple scheduler in 50 Lines of Code
To run the scheduler download the file or clone the repository. 
Then run ./scheduler.sh <start_time> <stop_time> <command>
start_time is when you want the program to start, and stop_time is when you want it to stop. The start of peak hours would serve as input to stop_time and the stop of peak hours would be input to start_time at stop_time
eg: ./scheduler.sh 5:30 9:50 "ollama serve"
